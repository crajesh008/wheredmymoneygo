**Where'd My Money Go?**

## Inspiration
As an international student, managing finances is essential. Living away from home means handling tuition, housing, food, transportation, and daily expenses, all while staying within a budget. I realized that keeping track of where my money was going each month was becoming increasingly important, but doing it manually was time-consuming and difficult to maintain.
This website was created to solve that problem. It provides a simple and efficient way to record expenses, organize spending, and visualize financial habits. The goal is to make budgeting easier, clearer, and more consistent especially for students who are learning to manage their finances independently.

## What it does
The website helps users easily track and manage their expenses by allowing them to record daily spending, categorize transactions, and view summaries over different time periods. It provides a clear picture of where money is going and helps identify spending patterns, making budgeting and financial planning more effective. Overall, it serves as a simple and efficient tool for anyone—especially students living independently—to stay organized and financially responsible.

## How we built it
Frontend: Built with Lovable App for rapid prototyping and clean UI.
Backend / Logic: Simple expense storage and categorization logic handled directly in the frontend with mock data — no heavy backend to keep it lightweight for the hackathon.
Data Input: Users can manually add transactions with categories like Food, Travel, Shopping, etc., which get grouped to show spending patterns.
Visualization: We used chart components to generate a spending breakdown that answers the golden question — “Where the hell did my money go?”
Design: Focused on minimal, relatable UX — everything in plain English so users instantly get it.

## Challenges we ran into
Data Visualization: Making charts that actually look good and update correctly was a bit of a challenge for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our biggest accomplishments is how much we learned throughout this project. Some of us started with little to no experience in the programming language and tools we used, but we took the initiative to learn, explore new concepts, and apply them in real time. We collaborated, problem-solved, and supported each other, which allowed us to not only build a functioning website, but also grow our technical confidence. Completing this project showed us that with determination and teamwork, we can step outside our comfort zones and achieve meaningful results.

## What we learned
People don’t overspend because they lack financial knowledge — they overspend because emotions often drive decisions.
Visualizing data is helpful, but what truly matters is interpreting behavior behind the numbers.
Even a lightweight, rule-based “AI” can deliver powerful insights when framed around user psychology.
The concept of an “emotional spending mirror” strongly resonates — users want tools that understand, not judge.
Simplicity, empathy, and clear storytelling matter more than technical complexity in early-stage prototypes.

## What's next for Where'd My Money Go?
AI Insight Engine: Train a real model to detect emotional triggers and spending moods using user notes and transaction data.
Bank Integration: Connect securely to banking APIs for automatic transaction imports.
Enhanced Habit Coach: Offer personalized weekly insights and nudges based on consistent behavior tracking.
Gamification: Introduce achievements and small challenges to make mindful spending rewarding.
Mobile Version: Build a cross-platform mobile app for on-the-go spending awareness and journaling.
